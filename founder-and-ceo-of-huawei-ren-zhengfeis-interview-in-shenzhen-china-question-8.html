<p>As the most of valuable Chinese Company we
can find in China, We pay special attention to Huawei. At Huawei headquarters
in Shenzhen，Ren Zhengfei spoke passionately for one hundred and fifty minutes
with Chinese media. Valuefinding noted down 62 questions of the interview in
English. we also annotated the answer given by Ren Zhengfei. The following is
question 8.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Q8 Financial Weekly: After the US export control goes into effect, Huawei's suppliers in Japan, Europe, and Taiwan maybe help Huawei a lot. If this export control won’t wok wel , do you think the US government will put pressure on companies like TSMC? Huawei can design chips, but it does not have the capabilities of the entire value chain. The following is question 8.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ren Zhengfei: If more companies refuse to
succumb to the pressure, then even more will follow. We don't worry too much
about this. After all, this is not happening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Financial Weekly: Considering Google's recent action to Huawei, users in Europe are very worried that Huawei phones will not be able to use the latest Android in the future. What's your opinion on this? How to deal with it?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ren: Google is a good company – a highly responsible company. They are also trying to persuade the US government to solve this problem. We're now discussing viable solutions or relief program for this, and our experts are still working on this. So I can't give you a detailed or completed answer today.</p>
