<p>A few days ago, two pictures were circulated on the Internet. Once again, the competition in the Chinese smartphone market is fierce. Among them, Xiaomi has once again become the target of public criticism. One of them is so-called “two vs dozens”. including 10 Chinese mobile phone brands including Huawei, Honor, OPPO, and vivo, and Xiaomi, it seems that Xiaomi is  besieged by other Chinese mobile phone brands including Huawei, Honor, OPPO, Realme and ViVO,  As for  Huawei and Honor, it is quite like a sense of sitting aside and watching the battle. It is said that OPPO returned to the Chinese market with the aim of besieging Redmi and Xiaomi.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among a crowd of Chinese mobile phone manufacturers, due to Oppo and Vivo's previous success in entertainment marketing and sales channels, so that Oppo and Vivo with a certain sales base, is considered is the most innovative to challenge Huawei.  Last year OPPO Find X and Vivo  NEX were thought to be successful to rely on innovation to build high-end handsets and get good sales, but from last year's performance across the Chinese market, the facts are far from as simple as we've seen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, although the picture appears to be
these Chinese mobile phone manufacturers in competition with Xiaomi, but from
the current market reality, because Huawei (including Honor) in the Chinese
market has been a big lead, Xiaomi has basically made it difficult to pose a
substantial threat. As early as last year, Honor has declared that Xiaomi is
not an opponent. As for other Chinese mobile phone manufacturers, in addition
to Oppo and Vivo, other so-called Xiaomi's Chinese mobile phone manufacturers
are nothing more than a bunch of "catch", it is difficult to let
Xiaomi bruise, especially with cost-effective play. So all that's left is Oppo
and Vivo, and from last year to this year Oppo and Vivo’s performance and
changes in the Chinese market, Xiaomi is, in a way, the biggest opponent of Oppo
and Vivo now and in the future.</p>
